<p>`Speculative fiction’ is <label for="ash01" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="ash01" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/anilmenon/assets/img/Anstey-poem-frag.png" style="width: 50vw; min-width:335px" /><br /> </span> a collective term for stories that are committed to the narrative construction of new worlds rather than the description of existing worlds. By ‘world’ I do not mean planets, satellites, spaceships and moons, but the entirety of the narrative setting in a which a story breathes. For example, the world of Sherlock Holmes or the the world of Austen’s <em>Emma</em> or the world of Roy Andersson or the natural world. For our purposes, a world is “simply” that which is evoked when a mind encounters a sentence. There is no right or wrong way to conceive a world. One imagines, that is all. Some of my work falls under speculative fiction, and this essay is an overview of what I have learned writing these stories.</p>

<p>The writer Peter De Vries— usually sideswiped with the qualifying adjective “comic”— remarked <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/05/24/riches-of-embarassment" target="blank">in an interview</a> that the cow shouldn’t be asked to analyze milk. The bovine, however, doesn’t need to be asked to opine. Read enough stories and it’s when, not if, one will start to write them. Write enough stories and it’s when, not if, one will start to moo about the art of the story. Last time I checked on Amazon, there were about 22,000 books on writing fiction and only 2,000 books on quantum mechanics. The inescapable conclusion is that writing fiction is far trickier and more profitable than solving inhomogeneous wave equations with nonlinear boundary conditions over the complex number domain. Why then yet another tome?</p>

<p>I would offer my excuses, but since I have no desire to add to the 20,000+ excuses already in circulation, I’ll dispense with the noisy throat-clearing and just get on with it.</p>

<h3 id="deciding-genre">Deciding Genre</h3>

<p>My interest here is in speculative fiction (spec-fic). Treated as a noun, the problem of figuring out a text’s genre is quite similar to the problem of sexing chickens. Apparently, day-old male chicks are indistinguishable from female chicks, and making this distinction (sexing) is crucial for industrial poultry farming.<label for="chick1" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="chick1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/anilmenon/assets/img/Martin-chick-sexer-book.jpg" /><br />R. D. Martin. <em>The Specialist Chick Sexer.</em> Bernal Publishing, 1994.</span> Novice handlers are hopeless at rear analysis. Fortunately, expert chick handlers can turn novice handlers into expert differentiators simply by providing a steady stream of accurate and timely yes/no feedback. The experts can’t give reasons for <em>how</em> they made such-and-such distinction, but it turns out reasons aren’t needed. Indeed, such reasons get in the way of training the novices. All that matters is the yes/no feedback; the brain “deep learns” the rest. The technical term for this magical feat is <a href="http://cogprints.org/3255/1/chicken.pdf" target="blank">perceptual learning</a>. Analogously, a novice scholar or critic may be initially befuddled as to why, say, Kim Stanley Robinson’s <em>Years of Tears and Salt</em>  is not admitted into the same genre as David Mitchell’s <em>Cloud Atlas</em>. By simply hanging out with the right experts however, they too can learn how to intuit the genre from the intimate tattle of the paratextual signals.</p>

<p>There is an alternative <label for="faul1" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="faul1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">‘Let the writer take up surgery or bricklaying if  he is interested in technique.’   —William Faulkner, <em>The Paris Review</em> (1956). </span> to this carceral approach. This involves reframing fictive speculation— the use of speculation in stories— as a verb, as a technique. Consider how the color of an object depends on the viewer, but its manipulation is nevertheless a vital part of the artist’s toolkit. In much the same way, the classification of a work as speculative/non-speculative could be argued to death, but speculation as a technique or group of techniques could be a part of <em>every</em> writer’s toolkit.</p>

<p>Before continuing, it’s worth clarifying that there is no such thing as “the imagination”. There is no module in our brains responsible for churning out widgets branded with little square roots of -1. <em>Ah ha</em>, we say, picking one up, <em>a nice specimen of an imaginative thought</em>. Treating “imagination” as a kind of faculty is simply a way of talking. A convenience, that is all.</p>

<h3 id="imagining-imagination">Imagining Imagination</h3>

<p>Imaginative thought, at its freest, is unconstrained by the facts of the natural world or the necessities of logic.  This kind of thinking is common among young childhood and the mentally ill.<label for="pit1" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="pit1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">Pitcher, E. G., &amp; Prelinger, E. <em>Children tell stories</em>. International Universities Press. (1963). </span> For example, here is a story from the <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1964-07977-000" target="blank">Pitcher-Prelinger collection</a> of 360 stories. The narrator is a five-year-old girl, Tracy, H:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There was a boy named Johnny Hong Kong and finally he grew up and went to school and after that all he ever did was sit all day and think. He hardly even went to the bathroom. And he thought every day and every thought he thought up his head got bigger and bigger. One day it got so big he had to go live up in the attic with trunks and winter clothes. So his mother bought some gold fish and let them live in his head— he swallowed them— and every time he thought, a fish would eat it up until he was even so he never thought again, and he felt much better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now<label for="steve1" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="steve1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/anilmenon/assets/img/SteveMartinLarge.jpg" /><br />Warner Bros. (1977).</span> here is a story from a Steve Martin comedy album, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let%27s_Get_Small" target="blank"><em>Let’s Get Small</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You know what I’m talking about. I like to get small. It’s very dangerous for kids, because they get realllly small. I know I shouldn’t get small when I’m driving, but I was drivin’ around the other day and a cop pulls me over… says, ‘Hey, are you small?’ I say, ‘No, I’m tall.’ He says, ‘I’m gonna have to measure you.’ They give you a little test with a balloon. If you can get inside it, they know you’re small… and they can’t put you in a regular cell either, because you walk right out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s wet our beaks with one more pairing. Here is two-year-old Daniel:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He broke it. He’s O.K. He didn’t broke it. It’s all right. The little boy fixed it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And here is a fragment from Samuel Beckett’s <em>The Unnameable</em> (1953):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don’t know. I’ll never know, in the silence you don’t know, you must go on, I can’t go on. I’ll go on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is not easy for an adult to regain the effortless disregard of children for natural ontology and Aristotelian logic. Nor is it a simple matter of mere disregard either. Beckett, as far as I know, is not trying to mimic a two-year-old’s storytelling style. Similarly, Martin, in his memoir <em>Born Standing Up: A Comic’s Life</em> begins by saying “My most persistent memory of stand-up is of my mouth being in the present and my mind being in the future: the mouth speaking the line, the body delivering the gesture, while the mind looks back, observing, analyzing, judging, worrying, and then deciding when and what to say next.” Does this sound like a child at play? When adults imagine, it is perhaps more akin to a repurposing, where certain cognitive freedoms of childhood are brought to bear, partly consciously, on adult concerns.</p>

<p>It may be that when adults imagine, it includes imagining being imaginative. And that meta-effort is informed by memories of childhood, not necessarily recalled, but shaping the imagining nonetheless.</p>

<p>Our capacity and willingness<label for="seb1" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="seb1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/anilmenon/assets/img/SebastianBrantPoem.png" style="width: 50vw; min-width:335px" /><br /> </span> to imagine has always been seen as a mixed good. Imaginary friends are indulged in children but not in adults. Why should imaginary worlds be treated any differently? Curiously for a verb, the act of imagining feels like a habitation outside of time. The great anxiety when novels became mass mediums was that readers would lose themselves in their imaginary worlds. The tension between an appreciation for the novelty and opportunity that imagination generates and the anxiety of losing social control, heightened after printed books took over the task of carrying words. It took, and it still takes, about fifteen years to build a literate person. In the fifteenth century, a book could be printed in a few months. Or “within a day”, according to Gutenberg’s contemporary, Sebastian Brant, the German satirist and bestselling author of <em>Ship of Fools</em> (1494), who composed a poem to celebrate the “new” technology.</p>

<p>Predictably, not everyone in the \(15^\mbox{th}\) century was as enthused as Brant with the flood of ideas. Resistance to the unfettering of the human imagination can be seen in three areas: science, business, and literature.</p>

<h3 id="imagination-as-fintech">Imagination as Fintech</h3>

<p>Enlightment-era science, rooted in a triumphalist narrative of victory over the superstitions and mythologizing tendencies of the past, was one of the battlegrounds. British Raj-era physicist Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose (Jagdishchandr Bose)— a pioneer in experimental electromagnetism, microwave research, radio waves, properties of semiconductor materials and chronobiology— received much criticism in the second-half of his career for his “emotional style” and speculative claims about plant life. The respected biologist Dr. Gerta von Ubisch, Bose’s contemporary, writing in <em>Der Biologe</em> about his work on plant response, emphasized that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It must be our duty to stop the mixing of exact science research with the nice wonderful fantasies. We want to have fairy tale books and science books; but we don’t want that the popular literature becomes a hybrid between the two…”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bose must have know what he was up againt. In the \(19^\mbox{th}\) century, the normative model for the scientist was the dapper accountant, with a stolid attachment to facts and an aversion for fancy. This is why in 1870, when John Tyndall gave a talk to the British Association for the Advancement of Science on “The Scientific uses of the Imagination”, the English press didn’t react well.<label for="dast1" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="dast1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">Lorraine Daston. Fear and Loathing of the Imagination in Science. <em>Daedalus</em>. 127(1), pp. 73-95. (1998). </span> The London Times snorted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The glory of a Natural Philosopher appears to depend less on the power of his imagination to explore minute recesses or immeasurable space than on the skill and patience with which, by observation and experiment, he assures us of the certainty of these invisible operations…. [Tyndall] confesses Mr. Darwin ‘has drawn heavily upon time and adventurously upon matter.’ We ask ourselves whether we are listening to one experimental philosopher describing the achievement of another experimental philosopher. We had been under the impression that Natural Philosophers drew no bills.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To “draw a bill” is akin to issuing a postdated cheque. The London Times was saying natural philosophers shouldn’t ask the audience to accept their claims as true on the grounds that they would become true in the indeterminate future. Scientists didn’t deal in a postdated truths. In short, natural philosophers didn’t and shouldn’t <em>speculate</em>. For all its celebration of creativity, Science continues to manifest its passive-agressive behavior of praising the imagination with one breath and urging caution in the next.</p>

<p>The use of fiscal analogies in the context of imagination was to be expected, because from the sixteenth century onwards, innumerable credit-based profit-making schemes were proposed. Indeed, the British Raj was one of the most spectacular success of such scheming, or “speculations” as they came to be called.</p>

<p>Speculation was the imagination bent towards making a profit. By the mid-\(17^\mbox{th}\) century, along with the invention of the joint-stock company and the share market (~1600s), the word “speculate” had acquired a thoroughly unsavory reputation. It was linked with colonial adventurism, economic and sexual exploitation, social disruption and spiritual coarseness.</p>

<p>Washington Irving, who coined the phrase “The Almighty Dollar”,<label for="irv01" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="irv01" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">Usually cited by despairing Cassandras watching from the sidelines of the latest speculation bubble. </span> best captured the mood of the century in his much-cited essay <a href="https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/about-money/stuff-dreams-are-made" target="blank"><em>A Time Of Unexampled Prosperity</em></a> (1855):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Now is the time for speculative and dreaming or designing men. They relate their dreams and projects to the ignorant and credulous, dazzle them with golden visions, and set them maddening after shadows…. Speculation is the romance of trade and casts contempt upon all its sober realities. It renders the stock jobber a magician and the exchange a region of enchantment. It elevates the merchant into a kind of knight-errant, or rather a commercial Quixote…. As he sits musing over his ledger with pen behind his ear, he is like La Mancha’s hero in his study dreaming over his books of chivalry. His dusty countinghouse fades before his eyes, or changes into a Spanish mine: he gropes after diamonds or dives after pearls. The subterranean garden of Aladdin is nothing to the realms of wealth that break upon his imagination.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many novels<label for="ming1" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="ming1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">Scholars of the Victorian novel have long known there is nothing coincidental about the realist novel’s connection with financial speculation. See, for example, John Vernon’s eminently readable, <em>Money and Fiction: Literary Realism in the Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Century</em> (1984) </span> of the era had a subplot or plot centred around a speculative venture gone awry. The irony of <em>realist</em> novels like Trollope’s <em>The Wav We Live Now</em> or Gaskell’s <em>North and South</em> dealing with <em>speculative</em> tropes foreshadows the irony of <em>science</em> fiction being praised for its <em>imaginative</em> tropes.</p>

<p>The story goes that <label for="far1" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="far1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">I. Bernard Cohen. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/986790" target="blank">Faraday and Franklin’s ‘Newborn Baby’</a>. Proc. of the American Philosophical Soc. 131(2), pp. 177-182. 1987. </span> when Gladstone asked Michael Faraday about the utility of this new-fangled thing, electromagnetism, the scientist replied: ‘soon you’ll be able tax it’. The key word here is “soon”. As in, “not immediately.” The present value of something is calculated on its future utility. Similarly, the products of the imagination need the reader’s ‘willing suspension of disbelief’ because</p>

<p>But doesn’t <em>any</em> work of fiction take the reader’s attention? They do, but the difference is that if the work belongs to a well-established genre or is from a reputed author or publishinng house or has flattering blurbs, then they establish the author’s creditworthiness.</p>

<p>However, there is one fundamental constraint on the imagination. Imaginative thought does not, and cannot, create something from nothing. Nelson Goodman almost got it right:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We have come to think of the actual as one among many possible worlds. We need to repaint that picture. All possible worlds lie within the actual one.”<br />  —Nelson Goodman, <em>Fact, Fiction &amp; Forecast</em> (1983).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above is a fictional claim. It may be true or false or neither or both. However, if we replace ‘possible’ with ‘conceivable’, then we get a fact:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We have come to think of the actual as one among many <em>conceivable</em> worlds. We need to repaint that picture. All <em>conceivable</em> worlds lie within the actual one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The conceivable does not need to be either possible or visualizable or representable.</p>

<p>A story consists of three kinds of sentences. There are (1) the sentences the author writes. This is the <em>text</em>. Then there are (2) the sentences that don’t need to be written. That’s because the reader and the author (may) have a lot in common. They share a great many <em>contexts</em>.<label for="pand01" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="pand01" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/anilmenon/assets/img/closure-panda-transp.png" /><br /> </span> For example, if I say it was raining”, then there is no need for me add that it was raining water. The reader knows what happens when it rains. Finally, there are (3) the sentences that the reader ‘writes’.</p>

<p><label for="cloj1" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="cloj1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"> ‘Like the concept of brunch, Clojure is so elegant that it’s difficult to tell anyone anything about it without somehow improving them.’ —Alan Dipert, forward to <em>Clojure For The Brave And True</em>. </span></p>

<p>Closure has nothing to do with the programming language Clojure, but “closure” too is one of those words that instantly makes you a better person, simply for knowing what it means. Let’s get to it then.</p>

<h3 id="closure">Closure</h3>
<p>A story consists of three kinds of sentences. There are (1) the sentences the author writes. This is the <em>text</em>. Then there are (2) the sentences that don’t need to be written. That’s because the reader and the author (may) have a lot in common. They share a great many <em>contexts</em>.<label for="pand01" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="pand01" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/anilmenon/assets/img/closure-panda-transp.png" /><br /> </span> For example, if I say it was raining”, then there is no need for me add that it was raining water. The reader knows what happens when it rains. Finally, there are (3) the sentences that the reader ‘writes’. An author can write “The editor said no” and the reader can fill in the rest of the Shakespearean tragedy. Gestalt theorists labeled this tendency— a superpower really— to complete things, to guess the unsaid, to finish the pattern, as the “principle of closure”.</p>

<p>This ability is so tied to comprehension, it can be put to diagnostic use. In “cloze tests”, psychologists measure a person’s comprehension ability by asking them to supply missing words from a text. Dr. Nasrin Mostafazadeh and her colleagues at the University of Rochester have extended these tests to story comprehension.  For example, here are the first four lines of a story, taken from the <a href="https://cs.rochester.edu/nlp/rocstories/" target="blank">lab’s homepage</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Karen was assigned a roommate her first year of college. Her roommate asked her to go to a nearby city for a concert. Karen agreed happily. The show was absolutely exhilarating.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, which of the following two sentences is “the right ending” (their words) for the story:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Karen hated her roommate.</li>
  <li>Karen became good friends with her roommate.</li>
</ol>

<p>The right answer, of course, is #2. But let’s consider. Is that the right answer? Or is merely the default one? Were an author to pick #2, it would make Karen all too normal. Imagine how much more interesting Karen would become, were the author to pick the first ending? What kind of person would hate someone who’s given her a good time? Closure entails reaching for the nearest default solution, and when authors provide a different one, they create a quantum of speculation.</p>

<p>The Gestalt theorists weren’t the first to grasp the importance of closure in leading us astray. Erotic poetry would, of course, be lost without it. Let’s wet our beaks with an example:</p>

<p>It is pitch-dark outside,<br />
My husband left today,<br />
And the house is deserted.<br />
Please, neighbor, do keep watch:<br />
I don’t want to be burgled. <br />
  —Hāla: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaha_Sattasai" target="blank"><em>Sattasai</em></a> [335]</p>

<p>Indeed. But closure operates at subtler levels as well. The reader can do more than complete a pre-imagined pattern. They may see patterns where they are none. They can’t help feeling that the text seems to be <em>suggesting</em> less straightforward readings.</p>

<p>Indeed. The Sanskrit aestheticians took this feeling seriously, perhaps more so than any other group of pre-moderns, and the result was an aesthetics of affect and suggestion of extraordinary sophistication.<label for="ing01" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="ing01" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">In the introduction to his <a href="http://www.gianfrancobertagni.it/materiali/tantra/ingalls.pdf" target="blank">translation</a>, Daniel Ingall comments (page 28) ‘… there is nothing in our Western classical (Greek and Latin) tradition of criticism that corresponds to <em>rasa</em> and nothing that corresponds to <em>dhvani</em> in the grand dimensions in which Änanda and Abhinava conceived it.’  </span> The concepts of <em>dhvani</em> (suggestion), along with <em>rasa</em> (the savoring of affects), brought to maturity in a <a href="http://www.gianfrancobertagni.it/materiali/tantra/ingalls.pdf" target="blank">pair of works</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anandavardhana" target="blank">Änandavardhana</a>’s ninth-century <em>Dhvanyāloka</em> and his disciple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhinavagupta" target="blank">Abhinavagupta</a>’s equally celebrated commentary (<em>The Locana</em>), ensured that theorizing closure became one of Sanskrit aesthetics’ main preoccupations. Let’s wet our beaks again:</p>

<p>White herons circle against dark clouds<br />
that paint the sky with their wet lustre.<br />
Winds carry the small rain.<br />
The peacocks, friends of the clouds, cry out with joy.<br />
Let all this be: my heart is hard;<br />
I am Rama and can bear it all.<br />
But Vaidehl, how will she live?<br />
Alas, my queen, alas, be brave!<br />
  —Änandavardhana, <em>Dhvanyâloka</em></p>

<p>First the context. In his <em>Locana</em>, Abhinavagupta comments on his guru Änanda’s use of an apparently well-known verse to show how a literal meaning (in this case, “Rama” pointing to the individual,
Lord Rama) is displaced by a suggested meaning. But which meaning?</p>

Everything is in their rightful place, but for Sita, and so they displace joy from its rightful place, his heart. Rama reports on his state of mind. But in referring to himself (Line 8: I am Rama), he needs to evoke a particular set of associations, because “Rama” denotes an infinite number of things. Even the relevant subset of denotations is infinite, and so beyond the reach of any mere enumeration. What the poet can do however, is to suggest, and thus sidestep enumeration altogether. Rama reports he’s hard-hearted and referring to the travails already endured, declares he will endure. But having evoked himself, his wife is inseparably evoked. How will she endure, wonders Rama. He sees her breaking down, and cries out: <em>Alas, my queen, alas, be brave.</em> My <em>queen</em>? The combination of “my” (intimacy) and “queen” (formal) is a reminder to her that the situation is not a private one. He knows her suffering will be enjoyed by her tormentors. A <em>queen</em> endures.</p>

<p>When Lord Rama says “I am Rama”, the words suggest a deeper tragedy. Vaidehi and he are one, but at the same time, he knows she’s not Rama and hence suffers differently.</p>

<p>Is this what the poet intended? Or are their readers (in this case, very sophisticated readers) only making cloud atlases, they way poor Percival Lowell did with his <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/collection/martian-canal-maps" target="blank">Martian canals</a>? Science may not be able to indulge such liberties, because science has to deal with ideas that are not necessarily false. Art, however, was invented to deal with objects and ideas that are not necessarily true. Or as Clayton Hamilton explained in his insightful little book, <em>The Art of Fiction</em> (1911):<label for="boy01" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="boy01" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/anilmenon/assets/img/Zacharevic-Boy.jpeg" /><br /> </span></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘It is only in the vocabulary of very careless thinkers that the words truth and fiction are regarded as antithetic. A genuine antithesis subsists between the words fact and fiction; but fact and truth are not synonymous. The novelist forsakes the realm of fact in order that he may better tell the truth, and lures the reader away from actualities in order to present him with realities…. Actuality is the realm of fact, reality the realm of truth. The universe as we apprehend it with our senses is actual; the laws of the universe as we comprehend them with our understanding are real.’</p>

<p>Closure is not the only thing readers do, but it is perhaps the most important. But how do readers <em>close</em> the story? Perception is similar to motion in that it makes no sense unless we also point to a frame of reference. In Gestalt theory, this frame is referred to as the <em>ground</em>. In literature, it masquerades under another name: context.</p>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>What do we know so far? A story consists of three kinds of sentences. Sentences the author writes (<em>text</em>). Sentences that don’t need to be written (<em>context</em>). And sentences that the reader ‘writes’ (<em>closure</em>).</p>

<p>Should I have explained what the number ‘three’ means?</p>

<p>If you were an octopus, probably. But otherwise, no. Numbers are part of our shared context.</p>

<p>The context is peculiar stuff. It’s the dark matter, not just of fiction, but of any text. We’re so unaware of the gazillion contexts in which we’re submerged, when we’re reminded of the fact, it often comes as a shock.</p>

<p>Remember we agreed that if it was raining, there’s no need to say it was raining water? Fasten your seatbelt.</p>

<p>We’re on Saturn. <em>It is raining.</em></p>

<p>But not water.<label for="note1" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="note1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">Perhaps inevitably, Baines &amp; Delitsky wrote a <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-7473-9_9" target="blank">science-fiction story</a> around the idea. </span> NASA scientists Kevin Baines and Mona Delitsky showed that lightning turns methane in Jupiter’s atmosphere to soot. As the soot (carbon) falls, Saturn’s extreme atmospheric pressure morphs it into coruscating diamonds. On Saturn, it can rain diamonds.</p>

<p>See what we did here? In science-fiction, which is a subgenre of speculative fiction, writers play with the <em>material</em> context. They play with our shared understanding of materiality and subvert our expectations. The resultant surprise is an intellectual surprise and evokes wonder, that most intellectual of emotions. Or as the Sanskrit aestheticians called it, the <em>adhbhut rasa</em>.</p>

<p>Though authors don’t need to write sentences to inform a contemporary human reader that buses have four wheels or Christians have many different denominations or people generally feel sad when loved ones die before their time, et cetera, stories may still make references to buses, Christians and what people feel at the death of loved ones. This may be interpreted as an import of the context <em>into</em> the story. However, “import” suggests stories have a clear inside and outside, and that is simply not true. It is perhaps better to pick a different conceptual metaphor, one that the old Gestalt theorists would approve of, and think of context as something that <em>grounds</em> the text.</p>

<p>This grounding is mostly done through what linguists call “lexical words” or “content words”; that is, nouns, verbs, adverbs, and adjectives. Conversely, a text gets decontextualized through function words; that is, auxiliary verbs, conjunctions, determiners, modals, prepositions, pronouns, qualifiers, and question words. When we speak, these are the word we tend not to stress.</p>

<p>Function words are words like <em>that, this, those, these a, an, the</em>. They are words like <em>some, both, most, many, a few</em> and <em>may, might, can, could, will</em>. They can identify but not grant an identity:  <em>she, they, he, it, him, her, you, me.</em> Function words are context-sucking vampires. They decouple text from any specific person, place, quantity, quality or time. The lexical density— the ratio of lexical words to total number of words in a text— is one measure of that decoupling. Higher the lexical density, greater the specificity or concreteness.
For example, consider the following two sentences.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>___  ___  the ___  on the ____</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Any idea what the sentence is referring to? Now consider this sentence:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Frodo put ___  ring ___  ___  ground.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first sentence has only function words, the second only lexical words. It is much easier to close the sentence in the second case. Lexical words act like hooks and cables for attaching a text to a familiar world. Note that lexical words are not the same thing as context. For example,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although <strong>JaxP</strong> could be in <strong>holoprotosis</strong>, <strong>Swarm</strong> was <strong>quantizing</strong> that the <strong>Waiting</strong> wouldn’t be in <strong>Paris</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The words in bold font are all lexical words. But they probably don’t point to anything in the reader’s world. They might as well be functon words. Gobbledygook is the unofficial term for lexical words that don’t mean anything but act as if they do. Gobbledygook isn’t uncommon in science-fiction, where the intent is usually to convey ambience or to hand-wave characters through an unsolvable technical crisis.</p>

<p>In short, mere specificity does not necessarily make things clearer or less disorienting or more grounded. Nor should it be concluded that function words are bad and lexical words good.</p>

<p>But there are many other contexts to play with: philosophical, linguistic, social, economic and so on. Though I have used the word “play”, it needn’t result in delight or wonder or any other specific emotion. Human beings are too varied for any such silly restrictions.</p>

<p>Speculative fiction is fiction in which “the” context is a key part of the story. Spec-fic includes genres like science-fiction, fantasy, magic-realism, irrealism, surreal fiction, and many others where the context isn’t a given. In ordinary fiction (representational fiction) the context stands outside the story, something like a taken-for-granted domestic servant.</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean anything goes in the telling of the story. On the contrary, the author has to be even more careful about mismanaging the reader’s expectations. It’s a difficult form to master and one easy to mangle. All stories are a balance between statement and suggestion. Representational fiction, or mainstream fiction as it’s usually called, the kind of naturalistic writing taught in many MFA programs and English departments, tends to focus on suggestion derived from interiority. Speculative fiction broadens the possibilities of suggestion to the story’s externals, its contexts.</p>

<p>If you’re new to spec-fic, then it might take a while to get comfortable with the ambiguity, uncertainty and novelty in the stories. Some sentences might seem like puzzles (Samuel Delaney: “The red sun is high, the blue low”); others may appear factually incorrect (Greg Egan: “Okay, he’s dead. You can talk to him now.”); some play with the subjunctive mood (Anil Menon: “Of course, it is not necessary to assume Padma had always been Indian. She is certainly Indian now.”); and some play for play’s sake:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘At first sight everything may lead to believe that Palafox is a chick, a simple chick, after his eggshell breaks open, a baby ostrich like many that are born every day in the world, with long legs and an elongated neck, a very ordinary baby giraffe, with yellow fur and brown spots, one of these silent and fearsome leopards, ready to eat a man, a blue shark like all blue sharks, bloodthirsty, all in all another bothersome mosquito, with its very customary trunk, an ordinary baby elephant, but one begins to doubt. Palafox croaks. Palafox licks our face and our hands. So our certainties vacillate. Let’s take a closer look at Palafox…’
   —Eric Chevillard, <em>Palafox</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chevillard’s Palafox does not have a body we can categorize, and accordingly, a mind we cannot categorize. And that is the point. Literature, we are often told, tells us what it means to be human. How limiting. How tragically narrow in conception. One might as well say: literature is about being Asian or a man or a clown. We can do better.</p>

<h2 id="kinds-of-minds">Kinds of Minds</h2>

<p>It seems to be generally accepted in narratology that the task of narrative fiction is to represent consciousness (What? did you think it was to entertain the reader?). Dorrit Cohn was an indefatigable proponent of this view, and in her book <em>Transparent Minds: Narrative Modes for Presenting Consciousness in Fiction</em>, quotes an earlier pioneer Kate Hamburger with approval:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Narrative fiction is the only literary genre, as well as the only kind of narrative, in which the unspoken thoughts, feelings, perceptions of a person other than the speaker can be portrayed.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But why should we restrict consciousness to human consciousness? Or to put it more provocatively, human bodies? Mainstream fiction has no dearth of unconventional narrators. Ian McEwan’s <em>Nutshell</em> is narrated by a foetus. Ditto for Muriel Spark’s <em>The First year of my life.</em> Kafka’s <em>Metamorphosis</em> is haunted by a bug, quite literally. Not to be done, Julian Barnes’ <em>A History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters</em> is narrated by a woodworm. Tibor Fischer’s <em>The Collector Collector</em> has a chatty antique bowl, while a self-aware supermarket trolley keeps us up-to-date in Bo Fowler’s <em>Scepticism Inc.</em> Alice Sebold’s novel <em>The Lovely Bones</em> and Orhan Pamuk’s <em>My Name Is Red</em> have dead narrators. So on and so forth.</p>

<p>But just like Star Trek’s aliens are as Bill Maher put it, “simply humans with various skin diseases”, the above unconventional narrators above are just repositories for the author’s voice. There is nothing “un-human” about them. They are mostly gimmicks.</p>

<p>A truly speculative take on consciousness would challenge many of our shared assumptions about the mind. Sometimes this can be as simple as moving a story 10,000 years in the apocalyptic future, as Russell Hoban did in <em>Riddley Walker</em>.</p>

<p>Hoban’s story-telling protagonist takes his band across Yorkshire’s desolate landscape as humanity enter its final phase of extinction.  Hoban was aware that if people 10,000 years in the future were to speak like us then they’d become nothing but modern humans dressed up in funny clothes (the Star Trek syndrome). With its distorted metaphors and monstrous beauty, for me Riddleyspeak ranks right up there with Orwell’s Newspeak or Burgess’ Nadsat.  It’s as if bruised and bloodied boxers had been hired to ramp-walk haute couture designs. Here is the opening sentence, unlikely to make it on any of Buzzfeed greatest lists.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘On my naming day when I come 12 I gone front spear and kilt a wyld boar he parbly ben the las wyld pig on the Bundel Downs any how there hadnt ben none for a long time before him nor I aint looking to see none agen.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s hard to contemplate reading the entire novel.</p>

<p>………………………………………………………………..
Imaginative resistance comes in two flavors. The first is the rejection of an author’s authority over what they would have us imagine. Usually, such rejection seem to arise when authors make moral claims that are offensive to our sense of what is right and wrong. But it can also arise in other ways. For example, the recent outcry over blackwashing— black actors playing white characters in historical dramas— is an illustration of how some viewers resist what they’re asked to imagine. Similarly, children resist story-telling which deviate from the versions they’re familiar with (<em>It’s Jack and Jill, not Jaspal and Jill!</em>).<label for="child1" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="child1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">Children imagine in distinctly different ways from adults. </span></p>

<p>The second kind of imaginative resistance is the resistance to imagination itself.</p>
