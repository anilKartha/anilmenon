<p>(Zubaan Books, 2009)</p>

<h3 id="about-the-novel">About The Novel</h3>
<p>My debut novel, <em>The Beast With Nine Billion Feet</em>, was published in November 2009 by
<a href="http://www.zubaanbooks.com/" target="blank">Zubaan Books</a>, India’s first feminist press. The novel achieved a few firsts, but the one I relish the most is the fact that it made me Zubaan’s first male novelist. Zubaan has published some fine authors— Priya Sarukkai Chabria, Shashi Deshpande, Mahasweta Devi, Shama Futehally, Indira Goswami, Gita Hariharan, Manjula Padmanabhan and Vandana Singh to mention a few— and I’m thrilled to join their company.</p>

<p>All right. I can’t delay this any more. What is the novel about?</p>

<p>The novel is set in a near-future India; specifically, the city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune" target="blank">Pune</a> in 2040 AD. Thirteen-year-old Tara and her seventeen-year-old brother Aditya are dealing with the grim legacy of their father, Sivan, once a celebrated geneticist, but now on the run from the law. Everything changes for the better when Tara meets Ria and Francis, siblings who claim to be from Sweden. However, their formidable mother Vispala, who’s an old colleague of Sivan, has more than a casual interest in Aditya’s technical talents. As Tara, aided by the siblings, uncovers Vispala’s deadly plot, Aditya, increasingly under Vispala’s sway, discovers he’s carrying a secret, one that will unravel all that he holds dear. At stake is the outcome of a certain experiment on the beast with nine billion scurrying feet.</p>

<p>Writing the Beast was a lot of fun. I grew to love my characters, even the unlovable ones. Though I was spoke for them, I came to believe they were speaking through me. That’s perhaps the closest an author can get to being God. It was interesting to think through how a near-future India might look. I was able to do my ‘umble bit to bring the word ‘quakebuttock’ back into circulation. I got to use a German word made-up by my friend Herr Doktor Professor <a href="https://www.escp.eu/mauer-rene" title="Rene Mauer" target="blank">Rene Mauér</a>, namely, <em>Klatschschmierschnauze</em> (~ smack-snout-smear) which describes what happens when a pie says hi to a face. Precision is important in these matters.</p>

<h3 id="reception">Reception</h3>

<p>The novel was fortunate in its readers. I sent a complimentary copy to Ursula K. Le Guin, and she loved it.  The book was already out, but for the next edition, she offered a blurb:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Dazzling, funny, complicated, edgy— an irresistible 13-year-old heroine, a 17-year-old prodigy/dyslexic/athletic/mixed-up hero, and an incandescent plot.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>The Beast</em> was short-listed for the 2010 Vodafone-Crossword Fiction award and the Carl Baxter Society’s Parallax Prize. <a href="http://www.soas.ac.uk/staff/staff32041.php" title="Amina Yaqin" target="blank">Amina Yaqin</a> at <a href="href=http://www.soas.ac.uk/about/" title="SOAS Website" target="blank">SOAS</a> it as a resource text in her Literature of South Asia class. It has been the subject of a doctoral thesis, and a research paper or two. I received touching fan mail from a few teenagers. Some of the novel’s more implausible technologies such as the use of Norris-Pompei focusing for listening with one’s eyes turned out to be <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/402725/the-sound-war/" title="MIT Review on Norris-Pompei focusing" target="blank">not so implausible</a> after all.</p>

<p>I hope you will enjoy the novel.</p>

<h3 id="origins">Origins</h3>

<p>Most of friends in the dot-com era were either software developers or people for whom software represented far more than a means to a better world. It was a new conceptual metaphor, a new mode of organization, a new road to a making a human being without the flaws of human beings.</p>

<p>Is there a software program as lovely as the gene? It is tempting to look at a software program and to look at DNA and come to the erroneous conclusion that Nature is the Great Programmer. It is tempting for the same reason that Descartes saw human mechanisms in Swiss puppets and telegraph networks were once tempting models of our brains and clocks once used to tick across our cosmological models. The limits of our artifacts are the limits of our imaginations. The reason why these analogies are compelling is also the same reason why each of the blind men of Hindoostan were led astray: a limited perspective.</p>

<p>Agreed, because the genetic code consists of triple combinations of four “letters” (nucleotides A, G, C, and T), it practically sits on its hind legs and begs to be interpreted as an assembly program of sorts. When we insert specific nucleotide sequences from fireflies into zebrafish, the fish start to blink; doesn’t that sound a lot like code? Aren’t children basically newer versions of their parents (and, like software product versions, not necessarily improved)? We can’t claim that life is about reproduction; given half a chance, von Neumann automata reproduce like rabbits. As for sexual reproduction, well, most of life doesn’t get any.</p>

<p>However, some evolutionists have allowed their analogical imaginations to run away with the spoonful of facts. For example, in his book <em>River Out Of Eden</em> Richard Dawkins makes much of the claim that the DNA is “digital”, as opposed to being “analog”. In one emotional passage, he remarks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Watson and Crick enabled us to see that genes themselves, within their minute internal structure, are long strings of pure digital information. What is more, they are truly digital, in the full and strong sense of computers and compact disks….The machine code of the genes is uncannily computer-like. Apart from differences in jargon, the pages of a molecular-biology journal might be interchanged with those of a computer-engineering journal.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The good doctor also goes on to claim that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There is no spirit-driven life force, no throbbing, heaving, pullulating, protoplasmic, mystic jelly. Life is just bytes and bytes and bytes of digital information.  We— and that means all living things — are survival machines programmed to propagate the digital database that did the programming.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is evident that Dawkins is conflating “digital’ with “discrete”. However, software has nothing to do with being digital or analog. Analog computers are as programmable as digital ones. Information is just a type of measure, math-speak for the “size of set.” It has nothing to do with objects being digital or analog. Both digital and analog signals possess information. To link bytes, software programs, digital processing and information transmission with discrete nucleic structures, genetic coding, biochemical processes and evolution is tempting, but alas, incorrect.<label for="shan1" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="shan1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">Shannon, Claude E. The Bandwagon. <em>IRE Transactions on Information Theory</em>. pp. 3, March 1956. </span> Dawkins’s analogizing is exactly the sort of irresponsible generalization that Claude Shannon warned about in his famous essay.</p>

<p>There are a number of problems with the analogy between DNA and code. First of all, the linear encoding in DNA is perhaps the least interesting of nucleotide inter-relationships. A given trait can be determined by the expression of many genes (polygeny), and a given gene may be responsible for the determination of many traits (pleiotropy). So the DNA embodies a network of relationships. Furthermore, this network is not a string of beads, that is, it is not a set of linear, sequential, contiguous, local, isolated units. Instead, the appropriate metaphor may be that of a rainforest; an intricate ecology of interdependent first-order (nucleotide),<label for="lung1" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="lung1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/anilmenon/assets/img/lungfish.png" /><br />‘Fish, considered in general, is an inexhaustible source of reflection to the philosopher.’ —Chef Jean-Anthelme Brillat-Savarin (1825).</span> second-order (gene), third-order (gene-complexes) and perhaps even fourth-order (purpose) relationships. This is why in biology, complexity is not necessarily related to the size of the genome (the “code base”). the lungfish (<em>Protopterus</em>) has 140 billion base pairs while humans have an embarrassingly paltry 3.5 billion base pairs. While the DNA’s chain of nucleotides does resemble a long assembly program, the resemblance is a deceptive one.</p>

<p>Should we attempt to make a better human through biological means? Is it ethical to genetically rework skin color or ensure congenital deafness is a thing of the past? Which bits of us are inalienable aspect of our being human? Should we attempt to live forever? This question, resistant to compromise, is already being answered in courts, labs, clinics, medical textbooks,<label for="bbc1" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="bbc1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">While updating this page, I came across a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20211122-could-mrna-make-us-superhuman" target="blank">BBC Future post</a> asking ‘Could mRna make us superhuman?’ </span> and of course, the Almighty media.</p>

<p>It is sometimes the case that our first public work is the outcome of an ending phase in our lives. So it was with <em>The Beast With Nine Billion Feet</em>. Though I didn’t know it then, <em>The Beast</em> emerged about the time I’d begun to get interested in writing stories other than science fiction.</p>

<h3 id="about-the-title">About the title</h3>

<p>Tom Wolfe wrote an article in Harper’s— 1987, I think — where he said that writers need to be out in the world tracking the ways of humanity, or as he called it, “the beast with a billion feet.” He was calling for a return to naturalism, and moving away from the rarefied Henry James type of lit that so dominates modern fiction. My concerns were a different, but I liked the title and adjusted his metaphor for the expected population numbers of 2040 AD.</p>
