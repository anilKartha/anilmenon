<p>(Bloomsbury, 2016)</p>

<h3 id="about-the-novel">About The Novel</h3>

<p><em>Half Of What I Say</em> is a political romance set in contemporary India. As the title suggests, we humans are incomplete creatures. We see things in half, our best efforts are only half-understood, we misrecognize whom we love, and we live in worlds half-fulfilled. Vyas, one of the main protagonists of the novel, is such a man.</p>

<p>All Vyas wants is to go home to his wife Tanaz. But his job as chief censor for the Lokshakti— the Indian State’s corrupt anti-corruption bureau— keeps them apart. Lonely and deeply conflicted over his sinister duties, Vyas writes Tanaz a confessional love-letter (hand-written and multi-page, naturally), which unfortunately ends up with Durga Dhasal, scholar, humanist and and all-around political nuisance. When the Lokshakti murders Dhasal, Vyas has to find the incriminating letter before it is too late.</p>

<p>The trail leads Vyas to other people with other necessities, including: Bilkis Ansari, patriotic cannon-fodder and true friend; Kannagi, a scientist torn between exit and loyalty; Anand Dixit, a businessman who collects ruins; Saya, a fading actress who believes she was once Shahzadi Jahanara; and Mir Alam Mir, an eunuch poet perhaps overly fond of Jewish jokes. Vyas in his quest for the letter is led to a subversive new myth that cannot exist in Vyas’ world. It is true stories make a difference. But the absence of a story? What difference can the absence of a story make?</p>

<h3 id="origins">Origins</h3>

<p>I began writing the novel about six years ago.  At the time, Anna Hazare had just captured the country’s imagination with his anti-corruption movement. I was totally fascinated by the propaganda, counter-propaganda, the passions it aroused. It was clear what the people <em>didn’t</em> want: corruption. But it wasn’t clear what people <em>did</em> want. They were united by a common negative, a unity supported by an extravagant suspension of disbelief. In other words, they were being led by a story. It made me very uneasy. Modern tyrannies are often mass movements gone terribly wrong. I started to think about what stories do, about how we misrecognize objects of our desire, and about how it would be if such a regime truly understood the power of (erasing) stories.</p>

<h3 id="about-the-title">About the title</h3>

<p>The title comes from Gibran’s <em>Sand &amp; Foam</em>. There’s a verse which goes: <em>Half of what I say is meaningless, but I have to say it nonetheless, so that the other half may reach you</em>. I cannot control how you’ll read the story and you cannot control how I wrote it. If I could control your response, I would find another profession. If you could control mine, what I have to say would just be your echo. At the heart of storytelling lies this primitive freedom. It’s a freedom that shapes all our arrangements; that is, it is a political freedom.</p>

<p>That is the heavy funda version. A simpler one is that my wonderful editor Himanjali Sankar and I were racking our brains what to call the masterpiece. This title bubbled up.</p>
