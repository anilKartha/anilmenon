      <h1 class="content-listing-header sans">Biographica</h1>

<p>I am a fiction writer. I am other things at other times, but mainly, I spend a lot of time thinking about imaginary people and their problems. It is an odd existence,<label for="abt-minus1" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="abt-minus1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">With all due apologies to \(\sqrt{-1}.\) </span> perhaps not the sort of thing grown-ups should be doing. People sometimes ask me if I had always wanted to be a writer. No, I had not. When I was about eight, I  wanted to be an accountant. My friends, when asked what they wanted to be when they grew up, would reply “engineer!” or “doctor!” Not me. I was going to be an accountant. I couldn’t wait to be an accountant.</p>

<p>For me, accountants represented the height of cool. That was because my late father, C. R. R. Menon,
<label for="abt-dad" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="abt-dad" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote"><img class="fullwidth" src="/anilmenon/assets/img/father.gif" /><br />Cherukulath Raman Ravindran Menon (1942-1995).</span>
was an accountant with Maharashtra’s Office of the Accountant General. He worked for a General! At dinner time, he would talk about his day at the office. Father invariably made accountancy sound as exciting as exploring Mars or wind surfing or being a detective. His eyes would shine, his fingers would draw numbers in the air, and in the mornings, as he got ready for work, he would hum. I wanted a slice of the same happiness pizza.</p>

<p>Instead, I became a fiction writer. I went about in an unusually inane manner.<label for="marquez-role" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="marquez-role" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">‘One night a friend lent me a book of short stories by Franz Kafka. I went back to the pension where I was staying and began to read <em>The Metamorphosis</em>. The first line almost knocked me off the bed…. When I read the line I thought to myself that I didn’t know anyone was allowed to write things like that. If I had known, I would have started writing a long time ago. So I immediately started writing short stories.’ – Gabriel Garcia Marquez </span> I studied to be an electrical engineer and emerged as a computer scientist. I then worked as a software engineer for several startups, working on projects completely disconnected from my education. It was all great fun, but I knew what was coming and wasn’t too surprised when I woke up one day and discovered I had turned into a writer. Once, I would’ve drummed up plausible reasons for the career shift, but these days I’m more skeptical about our supposed motives and reasons. I am a writer because I write because I am a writer.</p>

<p>I write all kinds of stories. When I’m cornered about genre preferences, I say most of my recent work probably falls under speculative fiction. This catch-all term includes genres like magic realism, surrealism, fabulism, fiction, science fiction and other genres where the imagination is deeply valued. To get a sense of why it’s a different kind of fiction, think about how abstract art changed the way we see things. Or you could read Naiyer Masud’s <a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/2013/20130930/2masud-f.shtml" title="Sheesha Ghat" target="blank"><em>Sheesha Ghat</em></a> or a <label for="abt-sfdef" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="abt-sfdef" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">Or you can <a href="http://anilmenon.com/blog/?p=1822" target="blank">ask the cow</a>. </span> Kannada folktale, <a href="http://anilmenon.com/blog/a-perfect-tale/" title="A Perfect Tale" target="blank"><em>A Story and a Song</em></a>.</p>

<p>Truth is, I don’t take genre labels seriously. We must not to let a division of labor become a division of laborers. This goes for writers as well as readers. Personally, I see literature the way a goat sees the world; that is, a buffet. I hope you do too.</p>

<p>My most recent novel <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/half-of-what-i-say-9789385436512/" target="blank"><em>Half Of What I Say</em></a> (Bloomsbury, 2015) was shortlisted for the 2016 Hindu Literary Award. My debut novel <a href="http://anilmenon.com/blog/wp-admin/beast.html" target="blank"><em>The Beast With Nine Billion Feet</em></a> (Zubaan, 2009) was shortlisted for the 2009 Crossword Prize and the Carl Baxter Society’s Parallax Award. Along with Vandana Singh, I co-edited <a href="http://zubaanbooks.com/shop/breaking-the-bow-speculative-fiction-inspired-by-the-ramayana/" target="blank"><em>Breaking The Bow</em></a> (Zubaan Books, 2012),<label for="abt-sun" class="margin-toggle"> ⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="abt-sun" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="marginnote">Begin, ephebe, by perceiving the idea<br /> Of this invention, this invented world,<br /> The inconceivable idea of the sun.<br /> – Wallace Stevens, <em>Notes Towards A Supreme Fiction</em> </span> an international anthology of short fiction inspired by the Ramayana. My stories have been translated into more than a dozen languages, including Arabic, Hebrew, Igbo, and Romanian. A collection of my speculative short fiction, <em>The Inconceivable Idea Of The Sun: Stories</em> (Hachette), will be published in Spring 2022.</p>

<p>I co-founded the <a href="http://dumpukht.org/" target="blank">Dum Pukht Writers’ Workshop</a>. This annual two-week residential workshop, currently in its fifth iteration, is held at the Adishakti Theatre Complex in the former French colony Puducherry (Pondicherry) in Tamil Nadu. Recently, I took over as fiction editor at <em>The Bombay Literary Magazine</em>. I hope we are agreed I am a thoroughly remarkable fellow.</p>

<p>When I talk about writing, my eyes shine, my fingers gesture in the air, and in the mornings, as I get ready for work, I hum. Remember I said I wanted a slice of the happiness pizza? Well friend, it tastes great! I hope you’ll have as much pleasure reading my work as I had in creating it. Thank you for visiting.</p>
